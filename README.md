# AppDynamics alert logger extension

This extension works only with the standalone machine agent.

##Use Case
Integration of AppDynamics alerting with tools like Tivoli or Log analytics tools.

Where an existing implementation expects alerts to be written to a log file.

Events are read from the AppDynamics REST API.

These events are written to a log file to be picked up by an existing log scanner.
